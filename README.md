This is a take home assignment to build a message queue feature using javascript, JSX, HTML & CSS. It is built in react-redux.

# MVP
- There should be a text box.
- A user can write a message and submit it where it will be added to the redux store.
- The message will then be retrieved from the redux store and display in a notification space.
- After 5 seconds the message is then removed from the store.

## Installation

Clone the repository and in the main folder run 'npm install' from the terminal. Once installation has completed and all dependencies have been installed, run 'npm start'. Use the app on 'localhost:3000'.
